# Version 1.4-2 (development)

* remove tests in `test_Durbin_factor.R` for `sacsarlm` and `spBreg_*` failing under MKL 2023-2

# Version 1.4-1 (2025-09-04)

* import `spdep` >= 1.4.1

* annotate `impacts` output with `"dy/dx"` or `"(F)"` to distinguish continuous and categorical independent variables

* suggest `codingMatrices` to expand examples with factors (categorical variables)

* introduce warnings for factors (categorical variables) in Durbin models (`errorsarlm`, `lagsarlm`, `sacsarlm`, `spBreg_lag`, `spBreg_err`, `spBreg_sac` and `lm.SLX`)

* convert `error` to `Rf_error` in `src/ml_sse.c` to accommodate R_NO_REMAP

# Version 1.3-6 (2024-12-02)

* Remove remaining `spData` ESRI shapefile use

* #56 add Anselin-Kelejian (1997) test to `stsls`, reported in its summary method, analogous to the reporting in the summary method of `lagsarlm` of the Lagrange multiplier test, both for residual spatial autocorrelation

* adding missing man page anchors

# Version 1.3-5 (2024-08-19)

* conforming with STRICT_R_HEADERS=1 

* Condition on forthcoming `tmap` 4

* #52 subgraph updates

# Version 1.3-4 (2024-06-10)

* migrate from ESRI Shapefile to GeoPackage #50

# Version 1.3-3 (2024-05-31)

* protect `errorsarlm` against missing `Durbin=` if only intercept

* fix longstanding bugs in `getVmate` in a non-default side logic branch

* add `return_impacts=` to `lmSLX` to work around issues with aliased variables; impacts should be improved to handle this case when time permits

* add `sqrt=TRUE` in calls to Matrix `determinant` methods in `matrix_ldet`

* add `igraph (>= 2.0.0)` in DESCRIPTION for re-named `igraph` functions

# Version 1.3-2 (2024-02-06)

* pass through SlX formula in call

* re-corrected #19 because the fitted model weights component may be NULL

* suppress warning from `multcomp::glht` as the test which throws the warning is discarded

# Version 1.3-1 (2023-11-23)

* move `expm` from Imports to Suggests #42

* added `zero.policy` pass-through to `spdep::mat2listw` calls in `predict.Sarlm` and to `spdep::sn2listw` in `sids_models.Rmd`; set `spdep` requirement to `1.3-1`

* corrected #19 because the fitted model weights component is never NULL, but may have a single unique value

# Version 1.2-9 (2023-05-25)

* raised #39, no support for weights in SEM/SDEM/SLX #39

* address #37; #38 remains (no formula Durbin support for prediction using any Sarlm object)

* address #19 by not reporting `AIC` where case weights are used in `spautolm` or `errorsarlm`

* address bug in `predict()` for new data, SDEM. Others in #37, #38 need work.

* Further added checking for SLX/SDEM impacts and edge/corner cases; starting transition to use **multcomp** in place og **gmodels**

# Version 1.2-8 (2023-03-01)

* Attending to SLX/Durbin/non-W-style weights: #7, #36, #26, #35, #30 #24, #23, partly based on #13

# Version 1.2-6 (2022-10-07)

* make local copy of `gmodels::estimable()` for lm objects only, add authors to package contributors

* -Wstrict-prototypes fixes

# Version 1.2-5 (2022-08-16)

* updating coercion for **Matrix** 1.4-2

* updating dontrun/donttest for package split (previously unchecked, mostly in `aple`)

# Version 1.2-3 (2022-04-18)

* protect definition of USE_FC_LEN_T

* unescape underscores in help pages

# Version 1.2-1 (2021-11-11)

* Add Fortran character handling USE_FC_LEN_T WRE §6.6.1

* Add **spdep** split-out functionality

# Version 1.1-8 (2021-05-03)

* #18 standardize use of `coef()` methods for (some) fitted model summary objects

* https://github.com/tidymodels/broom/issues/1003#issuecomment-798694400 changing **spatialreg** model output class names: **spdep** `sarlm` -> **spatialreg** `Sarlm`, `spautolm` -> `Spautolm`, `stsls` -> `Stsls`, `gmsar` -> `Gmsar`, `lagmess` -> `Lagmess`, `SLX` -> , `SlX`, `MCMC_s*_g` -> `MCMC_s*_G`, `SFResult` -> `SfResult`, `ME_res` -> `Me_res`, `lagImpact` -> `LagImpact`, `WXImpact` -> `WXimpact`

* #16 merged coordination of impacts methods (Gianfranco Piras)

* #14 merged correction to SDEM and SLX impacts when a lagged intercept is present (Tobias Rüttenauer).

# Version 1.1-5 (2019-12-01)

* #6, #11 na.action and precomputed eigenvalue bug

* #9 Griddy Gibbs issue

* #8 Predict method for SLX

* #7, #13-14 Offset impacts for SDEM/SLX

* #5, #10 Panel Durbin= argument


# Version 1.1-3 (2019-04-01)

* #2 Split spatialreg from spdep; spdep functions still present there as deprecated
